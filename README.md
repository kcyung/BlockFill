# BlockFill

This program allow users to select either a random or biased traversal of every cell in a two dimensional grid:

1.  Random Traversal -
    Starting at the top left point of a two dimensional grid, a point will travel in any random direction within the bounds of the window until every cell has been reached.
2.  Biased Traversal - 
    Starting at the top left point of a two dimensional grid, a point will travel a biased direction until each cell grid has been reached.  The bias is based upon the distance to the closest unreached cell.
    
Upon completion, the number of steps taken will be updated in the window.
