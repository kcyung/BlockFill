# BlockFill

This program allow users to select either a random or biased traversal of every cell in a two dimensional grid:

1.  Random Traversal -
    Starting at the top left point of a two dimensional grid, a point will travel in any random direction within the bounds of the window until every cell has been reached.
2.  Biased Traversal - 
    Starting at the top left point of a two dimensional grid, a point will travel a biased direction until each cell grid has been reached.
    
Upon completion, the number of steps taken will be updated in the window.
